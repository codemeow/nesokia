## Origin and Licensing Notice

The files located in this directory are generated outputs of the `pally` tool and are treated separately from the root license of this project.

The data used to generate these color palette tables is based on publicly documented descriptions of PPU output levels and on the study of the physical behavior of NES-family PPU hardware. The color values produced by such hardware are inherently influenced by analog processes, including signal encoding, component tolerances, and display characteristics. As a result, any digital representation of these colors is necessarily an approximation rather than an exact reproduction.

Equivalent human-readable palette representations are publicly available on NESDEV.org, whose wiki content (textual descriptions and representations) is released into the public domain:
https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_wiki:General_disclaimer

Similar data is also produced by the original `pally` script, which is licensed under the MIT License:
https://github.com/Gumball2415/pally/blob/main/LICENSE

It is important to note that, while there exist ROM-distributed `.pal` files associated with specific PPU revisions (as referenced by emulator projects such as MAME), those files represent specific binary palette ROM dumps and are protected accordingly. For example, MAME declares the following palette ROM hashes in its source code:

```

vsnes.cpp:  ROM_LOAD( "rp2c04-0001.pal", 0x00, 0xc0, CRC(a6293faa) SHA1(190a410a3d818e124b2b9d2ef9fb3da003bb5d4c) )
vsnes.cpp:  ROM_LOAD( "rp2c04-0002.pal", 0x00, 0xc0, CRC(fd19ae5e) SHA1(8ed14347c5a0b1a8a4d6365d6727e0951a00131c) )
vsnes.cpp:  ROM_LOAD( "rp2c04-0003.pal", 0x00, 0xc0, CRC(fd6c578b) SHA1(653182ce0cbaff66a8fc5788e32cc088b6735f2e) )
vsnes.cpp:  ROM_LOAD( "rp2c04-0004.pal", 0x00, 0xc0, CRC(0c2e8e4d) SHA1(0f9090225eb1f08ae5072d40af3e95547cbce05f) )

```

By contrast, the palette files generated by this project have the following SHA1 checksums:

```

de847d78e759c608b087b0e6e4f210b90776d3a7  2c04-0001.pal
c9de31312439159f16a4e9189ad660871aadedef  2c04-0002.pal
bac2437f52fb442690cf497c0fc3c35bbe83488c  2c04-0003.pal
258b8dfdf7b92c3d0061697712539c89308553ce  2c04-0004.pal

```

These differences demonstrate that the generated `.pal` files are **not binary copies** of any known ROM-distributed palette files and are not compatible with emulator ROM validation mechanisms.

The generated palette files are the result of mathematical modeling and approximation of analog physical processes, informed by publicly documented information. They do not constitute dumps of ROM data, firmware, or any emulator-required palette files, and do not correspond exactly to any specific physical hardware instance.

Based on the above, these `.pal` files are considered **license-clean derived data**, created as a technical and analytical output rather than as a reproduction of copyrighted material. The author of this project does not claim authorship or co-authorship over any original hardware data, but rather over the process used to approximate and represent it.

Accordingly, the generated `.pal` files in this directory are explicitly released into the **public domain**. This declaration applies only to the generated files themselves and does not extend to any original ROM images, palette ROM dumps, or emulator ROM sets referenced for comparison.

Due to the historical nature of the underlying hardware and the absence of authoritative licensing statements for original palette ROMs, absolute legal certainty is not possible. This notice is provided to document provenance, methodology, and intent, and does not assert compatibility with or equivalence to any specific emulator or hardware implementation.
