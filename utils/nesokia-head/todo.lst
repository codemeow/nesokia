XML: fields from nes20db by NewRisingSun (https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19940&p=248796)
json as per tree but lowercase (also only short forms)
add YAML (bool should be true/false, --- should be null, can reuse JSON converters)
add Markdown
add CSV (; as delimeter, ;; when no value, the rest as usual) - Maybe change "-" in vs to "" for this?
